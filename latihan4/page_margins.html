				<h2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN PRINT</b></h2>
		<p> Most word processors default to page
			margins of one inch. On standard 8.5" ×
			11” paper, that produces a line length of
			6.5”. That was fine for the monospaced
			fonts of the typewriter era, which used a
			lot of horizontal space. But for proportional
			fonts, they’re too small.<br>
			<br>At 12 point, left and right page margins of
				1.5-2.0” will usually give you a comfortable
				line length. But don’t take that range as an
				absolute—focus on getting the number of
				characters per line into the right range (see
				line length). The smaller the point size, the
				larger the page margins will need to be, and
				vice versa.</p>

				<h2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ON THE WEB</b></h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, web browsers had no concept
				of margins—text simply flowed from one
				edge of the window to the other. That
				wasn’t a huge problem at the time, because
				computer screens were much smaller. With
				the advent of CSS, web designers could
				use the margin and padding properties to
				create space between text and the edge of
				its containing block.<br>
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the web has never shaken
					the edge-to-edge design idiom. Many of
					today’s websites still look like they were
					created by designers who got paid by the
					square inch. Just as it’s important in print
					to let go of typewriter habits, it’s important
					on the web to let go of the habits.<br>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve text legibility, web pages
						need big margins too. There isn’t one
						margin size that will work for all web pages,
						but the core advice is the same as on the
						printed page—focus on line length. As you
						do that, you’ll find your margins getting
						bigger. Don’t panic.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 8.5” × 11” paper size, and the
				sizes of computer screens, are standards
				imposed on us by history and tradition.
				They are arbitrary. They do not represent
				anyone’s idea of a convenient size for good
				typography. But with page margins, you can
				reshape them. As proof, consider a print
				example. Are there any publications that use
				8.5” × 11” paper? Yes, it’s the approximate
				size of many magazines. But do any of
				those magazines run text in a single block
				on the page with one-inch margins? No—
				never. They use multiple-column layouts or
				find other ways to divide the page.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, are there any publications that do run
			text in a single block on the page? Sure—
			books are usually set in a single column.
			But do you ever see a book printed on 8.5”
			× 11” paper? No—never. It would be too big
			for comfortable reading.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional typographers never use 8.5”
				× 11” paper with a 6.5” line length. Neither
				should you. Whether you’re writing for print
				or the web, set your text according to the
				principles of good typography. The white
				space will take care of itself. The pleasure of
				reading an effectively designed document
				will soon outweigh the unfamiliarity of extra
				white space around the edges.<br></p>

			<h3><b>BY THE WAY</b></h3>
			<p>- A gutter margin is extra space on one
			side of a printed page that accounts for a
			binding. In a duplex (two-sided) document,
			the gutter will automatically alternate sides.<br>
			- In a printed document, do your margins
			all have to be the same size? No. To fit more
			text on the page, reduce the top and bottom
			margins. Your line length will stay the same,
			but you’ll get more lines per page. To make
			the text block appear centered vertically, try
			making the bottom margin about a 0.25"
			larger than the top margin. Otherwise, the
			text block can look like it’s sagging. Finally,
			there’s no rule that a text block has to be
			centered on the page horizontally. For an
			asymmetric layout, make the difference
			between the left and right margins at least
			1” to make the asymmetry obvious.<br>
			- The best way to judge a layout is with your
			eyes, not with a calculator. But typographers
			have long enjoyed fiddling with layouts that
			incorporate specific mathematical ratios.
			Most famous among these is the golden
			ratio, which is approximately 1.618: 1. For
			instance, if you set page margins of 2.23”
			on all four sides of 8.5” × 11” paper, the
			proportions of your text block will be close
			to the golden ratio.</p>
