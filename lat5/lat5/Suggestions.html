                By not purchasing products made from illegally sourced protected
                wildlife or their parts and products, you can stop wildlife
                trafficking from being a profitable enterprise. More information
                can be found through your national or local wildlife authorities
                or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
                or Wild fauna and Flora (CITES).

                We cannot always give money, but we can donate our time. Often
                wildlife organizations and zoos have volunteer programs. You
                could also help clean beaches, rescue wild animals or teach
                tourists about your local habitat.
