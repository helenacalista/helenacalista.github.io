                  On 20 December 2013, at its 68th session, the United Nations
                  General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed 3 March – the day of
                  signature of the Convention on International Trade in
                  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1973 –
                  as UN World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise awareness of
                  the world’s wild animals and plants. The UNGA resolution also
                  designated the CITES Secretariat as the facilitator for the
                  global observance of this special day for wildlife on the UN
                  calendar. World Wildlife Day has now become the most important
                  global annual event dedicated to wildlife.

                  World Wildlife Day will be celebrated in 2020 under the theme
                  "Sustaining all life on Earth", encompassing all wild animal
                  and plant species as key components of the world's
                  biodiversity. This aligns with UN Sustainable Development
                  Goals 1, 12, 14 and 15, and their wide-ranging commitments on
                  alleviating poverty, ensuring sustainable use of resources,
                  and on conserving life both on land and below water to halt
                  biodiversity loss.

                  Earth is home to countless species of fauna and flora – too
                  many to even attempt counting. This rich diversity, and the
                  billions of years during which its myriad elements have
                  interacted, are precisely what has made our planet inhabitable
                  for all living creatures, including humans. Historically, we
                  have depended on the constant interplay and interlinkages
                  between all elements of the biosphere for all our needs: the
                  air we breathe, the food we eat, the energy we use, and the
                  materials we need for all purposes. However, unsustainable
                  human activities and overexploitation of the species and
                  natural resources that make up the habitats and ecosystems of
                  all wildlife are imperiling the world’s biodiversity. Nearly a
                  quarter of all species are presently at risk of going extinct
                  in the coming decades, and their demise would only speed up
                  the disappearance of countless others, putting us in danger as
                  well.

                  On World Wildlife Day 2020, we will celebrate the special
                  place of wild plants and animals in their many varied and
                  beautiful forms as a component of the world’s biological
                  diversity. We will work to raise awareness of the multitude of
                  benefits of wildlife to people, particularly to those
                  communities who live in closest proximity to it, and we will
                  discuss the threats they are facing and the urgent need for
                  governments, civil society, private sector actors and
                  individuals to add their voices and take actions to help
                  conserve wildlife and ensure its continued use is sustainable.
